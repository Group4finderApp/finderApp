# Group Project - *finderApp*

**finderApp** is an android app that lets people click pictures and tag them with the geographic coordinates of where they were taken. These pictures are then laid out on a map-interface that other users can view and interact with. The app then lets users quickly find pictures of a desired geographic location to find out more about it.
